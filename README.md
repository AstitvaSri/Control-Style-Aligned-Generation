# Control-Style-Aligned-Generation

This repository provides a reference image inversion-based ControlNet support to generate Style-Aligned images.
<br>
<br>
The base code is taken from [here](https://github.com/google/style-aligned) which only supports controllable generation via a style prompt. I have combined the DDIM inversion with ControlNet pipeline to allow style conditioning from a reference image.
